SpaceTrash
==========

This is an experiment made for an university exam, a 2d game that uses just html5 canvas with its Javascript API and no additional framework.

In order to make the game programming easier a little framework has been built, it handles:
* animations
* mouse events
* keyboard events
* collissions, *almost* pixel perfect 
* custom graphic controllers
* homogenous transformation
* levels serialization and persistence
